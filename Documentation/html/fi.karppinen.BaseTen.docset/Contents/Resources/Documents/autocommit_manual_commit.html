<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>BXDatabaseContext has two modes for handling transactions, which affect queries sent to the database and the way the context's undo manager is used. In both cases, the transaction isolation level is set to READ COMMITTED meaning that changes committed by other connections will be received. The commit mode is set using -setAutocommits:. Generally, autocommit is well-suited for non-document-based applications. Manual commit is well-suited for document-based applications, provided that changes are committed frequently enough.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autocommit"></a>
Autocommit</h1>
<p>When using autocommit, each query creates its own transaction and changes get propagated immediately to other clients. Undo works at the level of -[<a class="el" href="interface_b_x_database_object.html" title="A class that represents a single row in a database table. ">BXDatabaseObject</a> setPrimitiveValue:forKey:]. For each change an invocation of the method is added to the undo manager with the earlier value as a parameter.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="manual_commit"></a>
Manual commit</h1>
<p>In manual commit mode, a savepoint is added after each change. Undo causes a ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT query to be sent. This causes not only the changes made by BaseTen to be reverted, but their possible side effects as well. For instance, if database triggers fire when a specific change is made, its effects will be reverted, too. When -commit: or -rollback is called, undo queue is emptied.</p>
<p>In case one client updates a row, BaseTen doesn't send the change to other clients immediately. Instead, it sends a notification indicating that the row is locked and changing it will cause the connection to block until the other client ends its transaction. <a class="el" href="interface_b_x_database_object.html" title="A class that represents a single row in a database table. ">BXDatabaseObject</a>'s method -isLockedForKey:, BXDatabaseObjectStatusInfo class and value transformers in BaseTenAppKit are useful for handling this situation. However, other than BaseTen clients don't cause the lock status to be set, and the connection could block.</p>
<p>The downside is that if -[BXDatabaseContext commit:] or -[BXDatabaseContext rollback] aren't called frequently enough, transactions could become very long, which is against their intended use. This causes server resources to be consumed.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="locking_rows"></a>
Locking rows</h1>
<p>When a database connection sends UPDATE and DELETE queries, the affected rows will be locked until the connection ends its transaction. If other connections try to change the rows, their queries will block. To handle this situation, BaseTen stores information about locked rows into its internal tables and notifies other BaseTen clients about them. <a class="el" href="interface_b_x_synchronized_array_controller.html" title="An NSArrayController subclass for use with BaseTen. ">BXSynchronizedArrayController</a> also tries to lock rows when the editing session begins.</p>
<p>Lock information will be available using <a class="el" href="interface_b_x_database_object.html" title="A class that represents a single row in a database table. ">BXDatabaseObject</a>'s method -isLockedForKey:. BXDatabaseContext has a method, -setSendsLockQueries:, for enabling or disabling lock notifications. If the notifications are disabled, BXDatabaseContext won't notify other clients but still reacts to received notifications.</p>
<p>When editing rows through <a class="el" href="interface_b_x_synchronized_array_controller.html" title="An NSArrayController subclass for use with BaseTen. ">BXSynchronizedArrayController</a>, it tries to send a SELECT ... FOR UPDATE NOWAIT query when the editing session begins. If the context is in autocommit mode, a transaction will also be started. If the query succeeds, a lock notification will be sent regardless of BXDatabaseContext's setting. If the query fails, the editing session will be ended using -discardEditing. <a class="el" href="interface_b_x_synchronized_array_controller.html" title="An NSArrayController subclass for use with BaseTen. ">BXSynchronizedArrayController</a>'s method -setLocksRowsOnBeginEditing: can be used to disable this functionality.</p>
<p>To make the changes visible in the user interface, BaseTenAppKit has some NSValueTransformer subclasses. See <a class="el" href="group__value__transformers.html">Value Transformers</a> for details. </p>

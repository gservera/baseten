Base\+Ten is an open source Cocoa database framework for working with Postgre\+S\+Q\+L databases. Base\+Ten has been designed with familiar, Core Data -\/like semantics and A\+P\+Is.

The Base\+Ten feature highlights include\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Base\+Ten Assistant imports Core Data / Xcode data models. \item Discovers the database schema automatically at runtime, including 1-\/1, 1-\/many and many-\/many relationships. \item Database changes are propagated to clients automatically, without polling. \item In-\/memory database objects are uniqued, and objects fetched via relationships are faults by default. \item Support for R\+D\+B\+M\+S features like database-\/driven data validation, multi-\/column primary keys and updateable views. \item Autocommit and manual save/rollback modes, both with N\+S\+Undo\+Manager integration. \item A Base\+Ten-\/aware N\+S\+Array\+Controller subclass automates locking and change propagation. \item Fetches are specified with N\+S\+Predicates (the relevant portions of which are evaluated on the database). \end{DoxyItemize}

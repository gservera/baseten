How To Run the Unit Tests
=========================
0. The SQL script will try to drop and recreate a database called basetentest
   and drop and recreate a user called baseten_test_user. Also, it will load
   BaseTenModifications.sql. Please read the scripts before running them.
1. Create the test database. A command like this should work:
   psql -f BaseTenTest.sql
2. Build the tests. If you use the Coverage target and build configuration, 
   a shell script phase at the end of the target will run them.
